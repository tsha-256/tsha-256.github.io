Technical overview:
We developed a secure embedded system to provision licenses for a satellite TV system. Only authorized devices were allowed to decrypt and view content being streamed from a satellite. The system included a tree-based key management scheme, protections against fault injection, and side-channel resistant cryptographic algorithms.

Our design was one of eight that remained unbreached throughout the competition.

We also designed cryptographic attacks on other teams' systems, including timing side channels and malleability attacks.

Non-technical Role:
I launched the team and petitioned the school for course credit. This was UMich's first year competing in the eCTF. I was a co-lead of a 30 person team. We placed 3rd out of 116 teams, beating seasoned teams such as UIUC, MIT, UCLA, IIT Madras, and more.

Key Achievements
- 3rd place in MITRE eCTF 2025
- No successful attacks on our design (1 of 8 unattacked designs)
